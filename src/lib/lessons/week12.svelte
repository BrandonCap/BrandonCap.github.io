			This week's discussion was mainly about how popular Linux is, even though it is a minority in the desktop space by a large margin. The discussion seemed to revolve around a 2011 article found <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718005048/http://www.focus.com/fyi/50-places-linux-running-you-might-not-expect>here</a>.

			The versatility of the Linux kernel allows it to have <b>many</b> use cases, and thus be used in various types of operating systems for various purposes. Although we don't see Linux-based desktops often, we see Linux typically used in enterprise applications, such as networking, databases, scientific computing, and most importantly, web-serving. In fact, <b>Linux powers about 67% of all active web servers</b> according to a study done by <i>W3Techs</i>.
