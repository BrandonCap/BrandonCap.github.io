		<h2>Linux Servers</h2>
	</div>

		<p>
			This week's discussion was on the advantages of using Linux for servers.
		</p>
		The advantages of using Linux for servers include:
		<ul>
			<li>Performance</li>
			<li>Security</li>
			<li>Stability</li>
			<li>Scalability</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We've talked about why one would choose Linux over Windows, and here are some reasons:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Cost savings</b>
				<br>
				Since Linux is free and open source, most distributions of Linux are free. With Windows, a license must be purchased from Microsoft, and pricing will vary depending on the organization (ie. enterprise pricing).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Access to open source applications</b>
				<br>
				Running open source software on Linux is generally more seamless compared to running on Windows.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>More reliable</b>
				<br>
				Linux and its software generally use fewer resources, and thus will result in running more efficient systems.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Easier to modify</b>
				<br>
				It is generally easier to modify and configure various components of Linux. On Windows, modifications come in the form of updates, which we typically would have to wait for.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We've also talked about why one would choose Linux over Windows. Here are some reasons:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Better support</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Better integration with Microsoft products</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>More complete</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Remote desktop access</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Scripting frameworks</b>
			</li>
		</ul>
